## My process

At first, I started working with the the html structure and after I figured that out I went into the css structure and it was pretty challenging at first but after spending some time and going through a bit of documentation and trying stuffs out I figured it out although I still don't know how to convert the entire structure into mobile friendly look for now i am much content with the progress of the project and thank you all for visiting this project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### Continued development
First of all, I have decided to learn how to make this project scalable for the mobile platform.
Continuing with  I will make more Web Development Projects in this repository! 

This repository will be a collection of ideas and plans for web development projects I plan to work on in the future. From small web applications to complex web platforms, you will find a variety of project ideas here that I hope to bring to life with my skills and experience in front-end and back-end web development.

In this repository, you will find a list of project ideas, along with a brief description of each project and the technologies and frameworks that I plan to use. Some of the technologies and frameworks I plan to explore include React,Node.js,Firebase, and more.

Here are a few examples of the projects I plan to work on in the future:

A recipe sharing platform built with React and Firebase that allows users to upload and share their favorite recipes.
An e-learning platform built with Vue.js and Node.js that allows users to learn new skills and track their progress.
A social media platform built with React and MongoDB that allows users to connect with friends and share updates.

Whether you're a fellow developer looking for inspiration or a potential collaborator interested in my work, I hope you will find this repository helpful. Please feel free to explore the project ideas and let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions. Thank you for visiting!
